    <section>
        <p>As a user of a Haskell library, I often want to refer to working examples, both to find my way around a library and to get started quickly.</p>
<p>As a library author, it is possible to include examples in the API documentation that can be viewed in the Haddocks. Haddock even <a href="https://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/ch03s08.html#idm140354810775744">has</a> specific markup for REPL session examples. However, a significant problem with this is that the example may not remain current over time, and typos and other errors can easily creep in - leading to a poor experience for the user who actually tries to use the example.</p>
<p>Additionally, this approach is not convenient for providing <em>complete</em> examples of API usage - it is not practical to include a complete single file program as an example in the Haddocks.</p>
<p>For this reason, complete example programs can be provided in a dedicated <code>examples</code> directory in the package. This <a href="https://github.com/minio/minio-hs/tree/master/examples">approach</a> was taken in the <a href="https://github.com/minio/minio-hs/tree/master/examples">MinIO Haskell client library</a>. To ensure that the examples stay current as the library changes, the examples are included in the package’s <code>.cabal</code> file and built on the CI system with every change.</p>
<h2 id="adding-example-executables-to-your-.cabal-file">Adding example executables to your <code>.cabal</code> file</h2>
<p>We define a flag in our project’s <code>.cabal</code> file, that will be turned on whenever a user wants to compile the examples:</p>
<pre><code>Flag examples
  Description: Build the examples
  Default: False
  Manual: True
</code></pre>
<p>This means that the flag is not enabled by default.</p>
<p>Now, to build the examples with <code>stack</code> or <code>cabal</code> a user would run:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code># stack
$ stack build --flag minio-hs:examples

# OR cabal
$ cabal new-build --enable-tests -fexamples
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we will define a <a href="https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-packages.html#common-stanzas"><code>common</code> configuration stanza</a> to factor out some build settings common to all our examples - this will then be imported in each example executable’s configuration section. For example:</p>
<pre><code>common example-settings
  ghc-options:         -Wall -threaded -rtsopts -with-rtsopts=-N
  default-language:    Haskell2010
  default-extensions:  OverloadedStrings
  build-depends:       base &gt;= 4.7 &amp;&amp; &lt; 5
                     , bytestring
                     , conduit
                     , minio-hs
  hs-source-dirs:      examples
  if !flag(examples)
    buildable: False
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the example flag is used here (on the last two lines) to turn off compilation if the <code>examples</code> flag is off.</p>
<p>Finally, we add an executable section for each example program as follows:</p>
<pre><code>executable BucketExists
  import:              example-settings
  main-is:             BucketExists.hs
</code></pre>
<p>It is now easy to add new examples to the package - each example just needs to import the common settings and define the <code>main-is</code> is property.</p>
